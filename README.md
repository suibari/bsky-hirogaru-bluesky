# Hirogaru-Bluesky!

"Hirogaru Bluesky!" means "Bluesky connects people widely." in Japanese.

This web app calculates engagement based on a user's number of replies and likes, and displays concentric circles of which users they interact with the most.

Since you can immediately see the interaction status of other users, the concept is to use that to connect with "friends of friends."

Please try to access it! (Not need to sign in or install apps.)

## Basic Usage

* Enter Bluesky's handle (~.bsky.social) to input box and press "Generate!"
* A correlation chart of the person will be created.
* The center of the chart is you, and the closer you are to the center of the chart, the closer you are to that person.
* The degree of friendship depends on the frequency of replies and likes, so the result may change after a while.
* The correlation chart should be generated in less than 20 seconds for most accounts.

## TIPS

* Clicking on each user's icon will bring up a menu.
* You can jump to the profile or regenerate the correlation chart around that person by selecting the menu item.
* Click the share button in the upper right corner to display the correlation chart as an image. Copy and paste and post to Bluesky!
* Generation time depends mainly on the number of posts, but should not take more than a minute. If the generation time is too long, try reloading!
